For making dialog with choice options, you should read this guide.
First please head to ButtonsChoice prefab. Create here as many empty Game Objects as amount of max buttons you need.
For example: 
In my dialogs I have answer with 2 and with 4 options.
So I create this chlidren:
- 2
- 4

Then I create empty children foreach button in created sections and name it by number orders (1 for first, 2 for second etc.).
Place this children in position where each button should be.
