# LOQUI
*Developed and tested on Unity 2021.2.0f1 version. Should work on newer/older versions, but not exactly sure about that!*

*in-dev state, not ready for being used as gamedev tool*

Loqui is easy tool for creating dialogs in your game in very simple way with help of documentation. System provides versality of features, but mainly:
* Provides visual editor for dialogs;
* Provides multiple choice system for dialogs, also for AI (with chances set by developer);
* Provides in dialog actions (for example, getting quest after dialog, or after some line of dialog);
* Provides fully customizable UI;

With this tool you can make dialogs faster, easier and make any changes to them a lot quicker.

## Project postponed
#### Why? 
Working on such big project during school year made that work boring and pretty hard. Also I couldn't add features in clean way and code was becoming more and more chaotic. Anyway I made this project mainly because I wanted to learn more about creating own tools to Unity, which I did pretty well.
#### What I can do with this tool?
So you can basically create simple dialogs with this tool. Limitations are that you can't add more than 1 dialog tree to actor. Also there can be some issuses with changing graphics of buttons in dialog lines with choice.
#### What with documentation?
Basic documentation page for first steps with the tool is done, but I don't see sense of writing another one. 
#### What will I do now?
Probably thing that I always wanted to do. Finally I will be able to create my own game, we will see if it will turn into something more for the first time. :wink:

## Installation
*Project not ready for being used as gamedev tool*
1. Clone this repository or download asset from Asset Store or Itch.io (not available yet);
2. Move Dialog System folder to your Unity Assets directory or if you want to check sample scene you can also move sample scene folder;

For first approach and building your first dialog please check [*docs file*](docs/FirstApproach.md). 


## Progress:
* ~~Visual editor;~~
* ~~Basic dialog system, player's able to enter dialog, play it through (with choices also);~~
* ~~Customizable choice and main dialog UI sections - buttons positions (general appearance) (needs some more testing);~~
* ~~Method calling system during dialog, methods can be added in inspector in visual editor, also with arguments;~~
* ~~Sound system - sound playing when added to some line of dialog;~~


## To do
* Multiple dialogs trees for one actor - tree will be played depends on condition that will be met;
* Customizable UI choice section - graphics;
* Redisign UI for visual dialog editor;
* Optimize code;
* Improve sample scene;
* Improve text wraping on visual editor;
* Finish documentation;
